                        Piano Pals in Schools</h2>
                    <p>
                        Piano Pals is a program run in partnership with schools that provides elementary
                        school students who cannot afford piano lessons an opportunity to begin piano study
                        with a middle school or high school mentor. Middle and high school students earn
                        SSL credit for their service. School staff (music teacher or counselor) identify
                        students who would be eligible in terms of need (children who receive free and reduced
                        meals) and potential interest. Students from any grade can be recommended. The school
                        provides the room and the piano/keyboard. The Tacy Foundation provides the mentors
                        and supplies the music curriculum books. Piano Pals is currently running in several
                        schools in Montgomery County, MD.
