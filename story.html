                    Story of The Tacy Foundation</h2>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>
                        The Tacy Foundation is created to celebrate the power of hope and healing in the
                        lives of individuals and communities, and as a vehicle that allows people to make
                        a charitable contribution. The word Tacy comes from a Latin word that means "silence."
                        This is a silent foundation because it is not the foundation that is important,
                        but the hope and healing shared through music and opportunities to make a difference
                        in the lives of others.</p>
                </div>

                    <br />
                    My best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer and treated at Hopkins Breast Center
                    in Baltimore in the late summer of 2007 and throughout the winter of 2008. To support
                    her healing, I began a project from my piano studio for Avon Foundation's gift bag
                    by inviting children to play piano from their hearts to help breast cancer patients
                    at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The 500 Sounds of Hope & Healing CDs that we donated
                    to Avon Foundation in the spring of 2008 were a year's supply for their gift bags.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After the compelling experience in 2007-8 with the generous response of families
                    and their children, the recording studio, and publishers, I decided to form a 501(c)(3)
                    tax-exempt nonprofit corporation. This foundation became the best way to respond
                    to people's interest in helping contribute to the above and future projects. The
                    children became so empowered by the magnitude of their donation to the Avon Foundation
                    at Hopkins that they all volunteered the next year to make CDs for Children's National
                    Medical Center in Washington, St. Jude Children's Research Center in Tennessee,
                    and Dupont Nemours Children's Hospital in Delaware as well as the local pediatrics
                    units in Montgomery County, Maryland.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Once the commitments had been met in making and distributing 900 Sounds of Hope
                    & Healing for Children CDs to patients, we were able to focus on a new project,
                    Music Heals, a CD project designed to send children's music to wounded soldiers
                    and their families. Music Heals became a community effort involving children and
                    their families, the local recording studio, two talented graphic artists, the printing
                    company, and many generous publishers of music. The CD donation projects have inspired
                    a larger network of people who want to share music and/or who are connected with
                    the military through personal or family service. MCPS SSL Pre-Approved.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Music Heals CDs project is dedicated to bringing music from children to the
                    troops. We selected this project because of the deep gratitude and respect we have
                    for the men and women who serve in the United States Military. Their courage, dedication,
                    professionalism, and sacrifice are an inspiration. We wanted to do something to
                    show them in a small way our gratitude for their service, and to tell them that
                    they have the support of many, many people. We also wanted to send wishes for healing.
                    We have sent over 2000 of the Music Heals CDs to Fisher Houses in the USA including
                    Ft. Hood, Lackland AFB TX, Andrews AFB MD, Minneapolis MN, Ft. Lewis WA, Palo Alto,
                    CA, Tampa Bay FLA, Cincinnati OH, Ft. Campbell KY, Bethesda Naval Medical Center,
                    Travis AFB CA, Walter Reed Army Hospital, VA Hospital in Chinle (Navajo veterans)
                    AZ and overseas to Landstuhl, Germany, and to the USO through the Pat Tillman Memorial
                    in Afghanistan, Kuwait, to Korea. We have sent Music Heals and Happy Holidays CDs
                    this winter to American Red Cross at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Denver's
                    Mile High Red Cross Center. The Tacy Foundation completed donating 2200 CDs for
                    the troops by the spring of 2011. The following is a description of each Music Heals Projects for the Troops CD:
                </p>
                <div class="box">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disc A is a combination of all ages and different types of music</li>
                        <li>Disc B is a different combination of young people and different types of music,
                            some composed by the children</li>
                        <li>Discs C through F and Disc H are performances by an individual or family</li>
                        <li>Discs G and I (Part 1 & 2) combine all types of music</li>
                        <li>HAPPY HOLIDAYS, Discs 1 and 2, contain holiday and winter music</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                A number of the children who recorded their music have waited for their brothers,
                sisters, aunts, uncles, and parents to return from Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of
                the children come from families who have immigrated to the United States from all
                over the world. They are so proud to be Americans! Others whose families have been
                here for generations have brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and aunts who are
                serving in the military or in the supporting staff for military.
                <br />
                <br />
                The founders of the Tacy Foundation carry legacies of healing. Each has survived
                and thrived after facing cancer or other life-threatening illness, abuse, loss of
                a loved one, or other trauma. The Tacy Foundation is created to celebrate the power
                of hope and healing in the lives of individuals and communities, and as a vehicle
                that allows people to make a charitable contribution. The word Tacy comes from a
                Latin word that means "silence." This is a silent foundation because it is not the
                foundation that is important, but the hope and healing shared through music and
                opportunities to make a difference in the lives of others.

                In the spring of 2011, 105 selections were recorded for children's hospitals, including
                Children's National Medical Center in Washington, Johns Hopkins Children's Center
                in Baltimore, Nemours Children's Hospital in Wilmington, MD Anderson in Houston,
                and The Children's Inn at NIH in Bethesda, MD. The four CD titles are:

                </div>
                Some children composed music for this project, and others learned their favorite
                pieces from written music. They all recorded their pieces with great enthusiasm.
                They assembled the inserts and raised funds to cover the costs of the recording,
                mixing, copyrighting, and CD production.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Happy Holiday, Disc 3, was sent out in December 2011 to Fisher Houses in the
                United States and Landstuhl, Germany for distribution at the hospital for the holiday
                season.
                <br />
                <br />
                The American Red Cross at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center requested
                800 Music Heals For The Wounded Warriors to place in each stocking at the hospital.
                December 14, 2011 they were delivered to Red Cross Assistant Station Manager, Kate
                Kelly. These CDs bring the music of 3 teenagers who composed their music and performed
                for the troops and for hospitals throughout the country.
                <br />
                <br />
                In July, 2011, The Reading Express, a pilot program for interactive storytelling,
                began at The Children's Inn at National Institutes of Health. ?How the Stars Fell
                into the Sky? was told by Claudia Scott from the Navajo Reservation. The Germantown
                Library hosted the same story for children in upper Montgomery County.
                <br />
                <br />
                In July and August, senior high students applied to The American Red Cross for the
                opportunity to become volunteers in order to play live music on the piano in the
                lobby of The America Building at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. They
                began in early September on a weekly basis. Since September four more pianists have
                passed through orientation and are playing there.
                <br />
                <br />
                In October, 2011, a new charitable project called Piano Pals was launched at Great
                Seneca Creek Elementary School in Germantown, Maryland. The purpose of Piano Pals
                is to give interested elementary school students who cannot afford piano lessons
                an opportunity to begin piano study with a middle school or high school mentor.
                Middle and high school students would earn SSL credit for their service. This effort
                is intended solely as a means of giving back to the community. This program was
                offered at Walter Reed for children of the Wounded Warriors. It will function as
                a summer program as interest demands.
                <br />
                <br />
                In November, 2011, another new project, Reading Express Book Drive, was launched.
                Montgomery College Child Day Care Centers collected books to ship to the Navajo
                children in Chinle, Arizona. The week of Thanksgiving, 12 bank boxes filled with
                all varieties of children's books were sent to Chinle Unified School District on
                the Navajo Reservation.
                <br />
                <br />
                November 31, 2011, the Tacy Foundation sponsored a live music concert at NIH (National
                Institutes of Health) in the Hall of Hope for patients and staff undergoing treatment.
                This will be an ongoing project featuring young people playing live music for NIH.

                <br />
                December 16, 2011 the Red Cross sponsored a holiday party in the America Building
                lobby. The teen pianists played music for two hours during this celebration. They
                distributed 200 Happy Holiday CDs from The Tacy Foundation to everyone present.
                This new Teen Piano Players Program for the American Red Cross Service to the Armed
                Forces continues at Walter Reed.
                <br />
                <br />

                of America, to Fisher Houses, to children's hospitals, and to those new places wherever
                they are requested.
